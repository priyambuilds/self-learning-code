Mastermind Game

This is a simple implementation of the Mastermind game where you need to guess
a randomly generated color code. Each color is represented by a letter.

How to play:
1. The computer will generate a 4-color code
2. You have 10 attempts to guess the code
3. After each guess, you'll receive feedback:
   - How many colors are in the correct position
   - How many colors are correct but in the wrong position
4. Try to guess the code within the allowed attempts!
