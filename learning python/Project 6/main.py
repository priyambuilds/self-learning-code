Words Per Minute (WPM) Typing Test

A terminal-based application that tests typing speed and accuracy.
The program displays words that the user needs to type,
tracks typing speed in WPM, and highlights correct/incorrect input.

This program is designed to be beginner-friendly with detailed explanations
of how each part works.
